# RIPv2_for_cosc364



A small similation of RIPv2 (Routing Information Protocol) using local ports.


routing information for each node is stored in the corresponding config file.

We execute the test1.sh file to start the simulation, and it will pop up various windows (in this case 7), each represents a node with its routing table.
